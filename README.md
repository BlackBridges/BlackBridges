**"HI THERE FACE HERE!"**

My name is SharkBait but if you want to call me something else you can call me Bait.

I am a minor. I enjoy car paint designs, marine biology, cartoon shows and much more. Planning to make a strawpage here soon. 
Yes, I fear that I am a scary pro >_<!!!! So block me if you need <33 


Disclaimer : I do not encourage proshipping or think it should be normalized to be honest, it is an unhealthy coping mechanism and I am aware of that. Even thought it's unhealthy is still helps me. I am trying to heal and the constant threats are not helping.

I am an autistic man with a passion for marine biology. I like to study sharks and cephalopods as it is a big interest of mine. I would love to find more passionate marine biologist out there!
