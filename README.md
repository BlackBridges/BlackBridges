**"HI THERE FACE HERE!"**

My name is SharkBait but if you want to call me something else you can call me Bait.

I know many people have different perspectives and opinions on pros and I get it I really do. But what I don't get is how many antis treat pros, the deaths threats, comparing them to the nzis? Like you says pros are bad when you tell them to kill theirself even though they aren't causing harassment to you guys. So please be respectful even if you disagree with pros. Thank you for understanding <333

I am an autistic man with a passion for marine biology. I like to study sharks and cephalopods as it is a big interest of mine. I would love to find more passionate marine biologist out there!
