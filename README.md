Hello my friends, I am Kingston.

I am into learning poetry and writing stories. I enjoy marine biology and strive to learn as much as I can of our ocean. This GitHub is made for Ashes Town only, my Pony Town GitHub being
[this](https://github.com/FreakyOc3anNerd). Honestly, I don't have much to say but I am an open roleplayer, I rarely ever restrict my roleplay to only my friends. Planning on making a strawpage for this account here soon. 

Yes, my skins are bland with barely any shading. That is how my style is, just simplifed with black outlines. 


Have a nice day, love.
